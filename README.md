## Project Descriptions

The app allows you to add the name of your favorite artists and have them appear in a list from most liked to least liked. The order of the list depeneds on the number of stars each artist receives. There is also a profile page for each artist where an image URL can be submitted. This will display the image along with the name of the artist on the artist-ranker page.
